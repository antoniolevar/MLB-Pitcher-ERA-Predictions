# MLB-Pitcher-ERA-Predictions
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the Earned Run Average (ERA) for Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers. The model is built in Python and leverages libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn for data processing and model development.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to predict a pitcher's ERA, an essential statistic that measures the average number of earned runs a pitcher allows per nine innings pitched. A lower ERA generally indicates better pitching performance. Predicting ERA can help teams assess and improve their pitching staff and optimize game strategies.

## Data

This project uses publicly available MLB data containing various statistics about pitchers, such as innings pitched, strikeouts, walks, and hits allowed. Ensure that the data is correctly preprocessed for optimal model performance.

## Requirements

The project dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. Key libraries include:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## Model and Evaluation

The model uses Scikit-Learn for machine learning algorithms, including linear regression and other potential regression models suitable for continuous output. Evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to gauge prediction accuracy.

## Results

The model's predictions help estimate a pitcher's ERA based on historical and current season performance data. Results are visualized in the notebook using Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing insights into the model's accuracy and areas for improvement.
